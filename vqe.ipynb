        "The following lines provides use a transformation driver in Qiskit to make it easier to run model problems.   In many quantum chemistry simulations, to make things more feasible to run, one often freezes electrons or define limited active orbitals of which electrons can be excited to.  The following function, ActiveSpaceTransformer, takes in the number of particles, and the number of molecular orbitals, and uses its internal routines to define an active space calculation based on the input.  While active space simulations have to be performed carefully when trying to calculate realistic data,  for testing purposes one can expect Qiskit to provide a reasonable active space and freezing of electrons, at least for testing purposes.  In our case, we reduce our simulation from a 12 qubit (6 molecular oribital) simulation to a 6 qubit example.   While this redueces the overall accuracy of the simulation, it does allow us to test algorithms with reduced computational cost without having to worry to much about specifying all the details. "
